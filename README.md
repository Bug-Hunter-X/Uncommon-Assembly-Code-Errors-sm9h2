This repository contains examples of uncommon errors that can occur in assembly code.  The examples demonstrate buffer overflows, segmentation faults and unexpected value initialization, and provide solutions to these problems. These errors are often subtle and can be difficult to debug, so understanding how they can occur is crucial for writing secure and reliable assembly code. The code examples are designed to be easy to understand and modify so that you can experiment with them and learn how to avoid making these mistakes in your own code.
